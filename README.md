# Fractal Image Compression

A demo implementation of **fractal image compression** in Rust, featuring a CPU-based encoder and early experiments with GPU compute via WGSL and `wgpu`.

This project is primarily educational â€” exploring how fractal image encoding works under the hood â€” and is not intended for production use. Video explanation and theory can be found in: LINK_TO_BE_ADDED

## âœ¨ Features

- **CPU Encoder** â€“ Fully functional (but *slow*), written in Rust.  
- **GPU Compute (WGSL)** â€“ Work in progress, using `wgpu` for 60x+ speed increase.  
- CLI interface for compression tasks.  
- Modular code structure for experimentation.
